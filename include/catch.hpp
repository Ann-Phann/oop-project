 * This is a convenience header for Catch2. It includes **all** of Catch2 headers.
 *
 * Generally the Catch2 users should use specific includes they need,
 * but this header can be used instead for ease-of-experimentation, or
 * just plain convenience, at the cost of (significantly) increased
 * compilation times.
 *
 * When a new header is added to either the top level folder, or to the
 * corresponding internal subfolder, it should be added here. Headers
 * added to the various subparts (e.g. matchers, generators, etc...),
 * should go their respective catch-all headers.
